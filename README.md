## R PROJECT- STOCK MARKET PREDICTION 
               

## DATA MINING OBJECTIVE: 

The prediction of stock prices has always been a difficult conundrum. So, to predict the stock market behaviour we will be focusing on the basis of k neighbours closest to that point. Here we will be using the distance metric and prediction algorithm. For distance metric, Euclidian distance will be used. The average of the K nearest neighbour’s outcome will be using for prediction of the stocks.
This algorithm starts with splitting the dataset which includes the four parameters open, high, close, low into training and testing dataset which is preferably 70:30. Then deciding for the value of K which is the number of clusters in which the training set is divided. 
 KNN algorithm it is a popular method for classifying objects based on closest training. However, it can be used for regression as well, though not popular it provides some basis for prediction with efficiency of over 50%.

## EXPECTED PREDICTION:

KNN algorithm is applied on the data for a period of 5 years to predict the stock price and compare it with the original movements for a period of 5 years. It turns out that the efficiency of the test data is around 65-70% if the data is not largely skewed else the accuracy is around 48 – 53%.
